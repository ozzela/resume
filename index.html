    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Ela, and the theme of my portfolio is "Resilience through Reinvention." When I started thinking about a theme, I thought about what really defined my high school experience. The one thing that kept standing out was how often I had to adapt. Whether it was switching environments, facing personal challenges, or pushing myself to grow, I kept finding new ways to move forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="resume">
    <h1>Resume & Internships</h1>
    <p>One of my short-term goals is to take on a leadership role in a student organization when I start college — especially something related to global affairs, health, or technology. I’ve attended five MUN conferences and, back in Turkey, helped organize my old school’s EYP (European Youth Parliament) conference. These experiences taught me confidence, planning, and how to bring people together. I’ve also been exploring the medical field — I’ve shadowed dentists before and I plan to shadow three more this summer. Long-term, I hope to work in a field that blends creativity, impact, and innovation. I run an art blog called artisticinsights.weebly.com, where I share my creative work.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container" id="sports">
    <h1>Sports/Extracurricular</h1>
    <p>About a year ago, I began playing tennis back in Turkey. With each practice, I learned patience and determination. Tennis taught me that progress doesn’t always come in big leaps — sometimes it’s the small improvements, like a better serve or quicker footwork, that add up over time. I also discovered the importance of discipline and staying focused, both on and off the court. I still play tennis here in California and I plan to try out for the team next year.</p>

    <h1>My Writing</h1>
    <div class="writing-sample">
      <h2>Sample 1: On Zinsser and Writing</h2>
      <p>For Zinsser, writing is a way of connecting the writing with the readers and I completely agree. While writing something, you should not always think of how fancy your words are. While you should take care of your vocabulary while writing, something that should be your top priority is your audience/readers. At times like any other writer, I focus on my ideas and my words rather then the reader's perspective.and this caused me to have complex writings that are not engaging at all. Zinsser’s advice on this topic was to simplify your language while writing and making your writing basic and straightforward.</p>
      <p><i>Reflection:</i> This piece reflects my growth as a writer, showing how I had to reinvent my approach to connect with readers. Initially focused on complex ideas, I learned from Zinsser to simplify, adapting my style to be clear and engaging, aligning with my theme of resilience through reinvention.</p>

      <h2>Sample 2: Fast Fashion and Its Impacts</h2>
      <p>Fast fashion brands such as Shein or H&M are also known for exploiting labor and using sweatshops. Workers, primarily young women who depend on this job to make a living, are often subjected to unsafe working conditions in these sweatshops. They earn very low incomes, despite these companies making massive profits. According to Business Insider, fast fashion production is responsible for 10% of total carbon emissions. The fashion industry is the second largest consumer of water. It requires 700 gallons to produce one cotton shirt. The water leftover from the dyeing process is often dumped into ditches, streams, or rivers.</p>
      <p><i>Reflection:</i> This essay shows my ability to adapt my research and writing to tackle real-world issues. Reinventing my perspective to focus on labor and environmental impacts of fast fashion strengthened my awareness and voice, tying to my theme of resilience through reinvention.</p>

      <h2>Daily Write: Before & After</h2>
      <p><i>Original (100 words):</i> Beauty hides in our everyday life; It’s something that can be observed. It can be simple things, such as the shine of the afternoon sun or the flowers at the grocery store. Beauty exists everywhere, but we can only truly see it when we pay attention to the moment. Beauty isn’t something that can be defined or created; rather, it’s something we discover around us and within ourselves. I try to feel and experience the beauty in every aspect of my life.</p>
      <p><i>Expanded (200 words):</i> Beauty hides in the simple moments of our everyday lives; it’s all around us if we take the time to notice. It isn’t always grand or dramatic — sometimes it’s as subtle as the warm glow of the afternoon sun filtering through the trees or the delicate colors of flowers arranged casually at the grocery store. These small details often go unnoticed because we’re distracted or rushing through our day. But when we slow down and truly pay attention, we realize that beauty exists everywhere — in nature, in people, and even in the ordinary moments we might overlook. Beauty isn’t something we can easily define or create; instead, it’s something we uncover. It reveals itself to us when we are open to experiencing the world fully and honestly. It can be found not only in the world around us but also within ourselves — in our thoughts, emotions, and the way we connect with others.</p>
      <p><i>Reflection:</i> Expanding this daily write taught me to reinvent my approach, adding sensory details and depth to make the piece more vivid. This process mirrors my theme, showing resilience in adapting my writing to better capture beauty and connect with readers.</p>
